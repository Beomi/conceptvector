At one time the Republican party was a progressive party under Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt.  It freed slaves and broke up the large business's, passed child labor laws, and concerned itself with passing clean food and drug acts that protected the poor.<br/><br/>Today this same party is in the pocket of big business, instead of extending the vote to all people, it is trying to repress the vote of minorities.  Instead of trying to make people safe it is letting children drink water that is unsafe to save a few pennies, in order to give tax breaks to the wealthy.  Instead of assuming our proper role in world events, we choose to dominate the world and spend far too much on a military, that really isn't keeping us safe, since we have to spend so much it is breaking this country.

17733157,"Two observations.   One, the Republicans are in this position because they were too democratic (with a small d) and let anyone run in their primary.   As a result, they attracted a large field of candidates, and expected Jeb! to be their shoo in.   But the voters had other ideas, and none of them could stand up to the exciting and media attracting campaigning of Trump.   In contrast, the Democrats process reminded me of a wedding where one lady was the only one allowed to try to catch the bouquet.   The DNC was so enamored with Mrs Clinton that they failed to see that the voter enthusiasm for her is pretty limited.   The Republicans are having record voter turn out in their primaries, while the Democrats have smaller turn outs, and Clinton wins big when the turn out is light.  <br/><br/>The second observation is that if the Republicans are successful in denying Trump their nomination, they have no other candidate presently running who seems at all attractive.  Rubio has not won a single primary.   Cruz won the Iowa caucus by dirty tricks.  And in his speculation on what may be in Trump's tax return, he reminds me more and more of Joe McCarthy.<br/><br/>And Romney has no business criticizing Trump's release of his tax return.  Romney did not release his until just weeks before the general election.   And when he did, we found out he took a $77,000 write off related to his wife's dancing horse.

The Tea Party folk actually called themselves a Party, with a more conservative and populist agenda than the GOP's.  Trump would not be a factor for the GOP in 2016 if the GOP had allowed the Tea Partiers to continue ranting, but not under its own banner.  Instead, the GOP courted this fringe group.  It led to short-term gains for the GOP--it took the House, and then the Senate, with the help of the Tea Party--but it may mean an implosion of the GOP in the long run.<br/><br/>The second opportunity came in the wake of the 2012 election.  The GOP's own internal strategists argued that the party had to alter its course/message to reach out to new demographic groups.  But even as the GOP controlled both houses of Congress, it did nothing on a range of issues that could have remade its image of the party of the1% and of right-wing political nihilists.    <br/><br/>It's long too late for ""frantic efforts"" of GOP insiders.

The people in any organization need to think it benefits them or they desert and 'go rogue'.  The GOP simply doesn't have much to offer candidates who are wealthy enough to thumb their nose at 'the Party' or who (after Citizens United) can raise more funds outside than inside the organization.  Unfortunately for the GOP it decided decades ago to build its future on a shrinking demographic -- but worse, it erected a fiction called 'The Conservative Coalition'. Why a fiction?  It consisted of small-government libertarians conjoined to authoritarians.   The coalition on one hand spoke of balanced budgets and on the other hand of more spending on the military while collecting less in taxes (forcing it to fund the Iraq and Afghanistan operations on debt!)  The conservative coalition  championed religion (usually but not always fundamentalist and evangelical Protestantism) while simultaneously praising 'freedom'.  Of course undergirding the entire structure was the idea of rewarding the wealthy with contracts and favorable tax rules, which has enriched such a small portion of the populace that those left behind started searching for heroes and Leaders.  The GOP, in short, built its house on sand.","<br/>",100000004235555

Clinton and Sanders imply the financial problems of the country could be solved if the top 1% would pay their ""fair share"" of taxes.  This is just demagoguery without stating the principles by which ""fair share"" is to be determined, and taxes from the top 1% are not going to solve all problems.

When it began to coalesce, the Tea Party was largely a creation of Rupert Murdoch, Roger Ailes, and Fox “News”. Faux News was the platform and the bullhorn that originally created the Tea Party as a movement.<br/><br/>Tea Partiers showed up at an event on 43 chartered buses. 43 buses materialized out of thin air? That was the work of a cowardly, dirtball, right wing billionaire operating in the shadows so no one would know his name – while he acted as a major participant in our supposedly public democracy.

A Republican with a slogan based on his WWII popularity (under the leadership of Democratic presidents) beat a guy who spoke with the American people in whole sentences and paragraphs.<br/><br/>McCarthy was stopped in a bipartisan effort. The rise of the modern politics of hate and division, divide and conquer in order to favor the concentrators in wealth and power (e.g. the famous Powell memo), was principally the work of Richard Nixon, part of Brooks’ political community.<br/><br/>As Krugman’s Op-Ed shows today, the Tea Party certainly is the creation, not an accident, of the last 50 years of GOP politics, Brooks’ chosen community.

The GOP never accepted Clinton as a ""legitimate"" president and sought to undermine him at every step of the way. <br/><br/>They did the same thing to Barack Obama following his victory in 2008, but not because of his margin of victory, which was a popular-vote majority. The GOP set out to delegitimize him based solely on his race -- the formation of the TEA Party even before the inauguration, the birther controversy, the ""He's a closet Muslim"" rumors, the refusal of McConnell's Senate caucus to take part in any governing from Day One.<br/><br/>The GOP created this Trump-enstein monster all on their own.

Another break down was changing the Senate filibuster rules to pack the DC Circuit Court, the court from which the Supremes normally come.<br/><br/>It is that kind of breakdown in regular order that so frustrates so many so often and now we have Trump.  the Tea Party, not my cuppa, seems to have arisen with this failure of Washington to engage on important issues and resolve them POLITICALLY.","<br/>",100000004233326

What we are experiencing now is what happens when regular folks, those who are conservative by nature, realize they have been had by the authority figures to whom they gave their trust. It's messy and at times downright ugly.  But, given the bait and switch that conservatives have experienced for the last several decades, it should have been expected.","<br/>",100000004233326

17707851,"Mr Brooks,<br/>I agree with your appraisal of the abject state of the political/legislative process. But I disagree with your seeming belief that the ""politics""of the past was a recipe comprised of governing skill and good intentions, wrapped in willingness to compromise. As far back as I can remember, the White House has been occupied by a consummate politician, and every action taken was steeped in political considerations. The Bush years are a prime example. Bush Chaney Rumsfeld Wolfowitz...experienced politicians all...with a legacy of stratospherically damaging decision-making. And then there's President Obama, a skilled politician and erstwhile uniter, who will leave behind a legacy framed in stark division and deep political mistrust.<br/>So, Mr Brooks, what and where did 16 years of political skill get us? I have a hard time finding a bright spot. The know-nothings have a right to be angry. As for Mr Trump, I'm a billion miles from being a supporter, but sometimes his rants yield interesting procedural ideas.  Would't it be great to punch Mitch McConnell in the face? Then practice the high art of political spin: it wasn't an act of violence...it was a wake-up call. ","<br/>",100000004233326
17707864,"I think Brooks got it right this time, and I'm glad to see that he's off his populist religious crusade. <br/><br/>While he is, in my opinion, completely accurate, we need to continue this discussion to include one of the causes of this problem that is rarely discussed, our two party system and our primary elections. The need to cater to the ""base"" in each party in order to win a nomination, gives us extreme inflexible candidates, and when that predictably leads to stalemate, may give us a complete nut job (Trump-in this race, I need to be specific). Cruz makes a virtue of gridlock. None of the Republicans are anywhere near the middle, where there is room for progress. The Democrats are equally bad, but like all liberals through history, believe their positions to be justified because they are helping the oppressed. To cater to their base, democrats leave those in the middle without a voice. How many democrats are actually in favor of socialism, assuming they knew what it was? Really, when Krugman says Bernie's policies are insane, you know we are on the extremes. I'd like to see open primaries, where the two candidates (regardless of party) who get the most votes then go on to the general election. But, how could this possibly be implemented in a system run by the parties?<br/><br/>Congress then breaks down the same way. Once, wise elected officials were (in the Senate anyway) expected to use their judgment. No longer.<br/><br/>The question, though, is how to fix the problem.","<br/>",100000004233326

What group are you indicting, Mr. Brooks? Other than the ""official"" Democratic Party, there is no existing commensurate Democratic-leading party that  has elected individuals to State and Federal offices with the express intent to disrupt and destroy the system. There are certainly individual Democratic politicians who are trying to shake up the system, but they still work within the established set of rules. One has merely to listen to the debate rhetoric of both parties to comprehend that one group is using politics to problem solve and is trying get things done, while the other is merely lobbing invective to rile up a base which in its narcissism wants to impose its values and beliefs on others and is willing to tear everything down to achieve that.","<br/>",100000004233326

Even Donald Trump complains of the corruption of politics by outside funding. As a result, we see a broad movement across the political spectrum, ironically on both sides toward the centralization of even greater political power in the federal government. Trump promises to bully his policies into action like a dictator. Sanders promises to give the federal government greater authority over health care, regulating college tuition, etc. Liberals happy to imagine their dreams come true, refuse to confront the implications of making the federal government more powerful, as if it could never become too powerful so long as it’s doing what they like.

And why not?<br/><br/>He is presidential in the mold of tough-talking, big-stick-weldingTeddy Roosevelt. <br/><br/>Rather than dismissing him outright because of his churlish tweets and bombastic personality, we should be coolly assessing his political positions and then figuring out how to cut deals we can live with.","<br/>",100000004233326

David Brooks is all of these things in addition to having a wonderful sense of humor. But there is nothing to laugh about these days and when I read his recent columns  they make me very sad indeed. It appears that his party has gone off the tracks and does not know how to right itself.

It seems however to beg the question, is this what the Republicans now in office and the current contenders are in fact doing at present? One answer to that can be seen in Mr. Krugman's companion piece in today's edition. Another answer could be established that politics of the Right as currently exercised is exclusively about the getting and keeping of Power. The different groups, etc. simply don't matter if balance and compromise are no longer the point. <br/><br/>The three central candidates on last nights stage represent distinct ambitions. Senator Rubio being the old school choice who would maintain the neocon status quo and reward supporters with such prizes as a new aircraft carrier battle group-roughly a Trillion $$. Trump of course is America's answer to Putin. He'll wave a hand and ""make the little lines around the states go away."" No rebuttal from the States Rights people? It'll be a beautiful thing. Third, and most menacing is the friendless Ted Cruz. One doesn't need friends if one imagines oneself on a divine mission.

There it is, the obligatory leavening: ""both sides do this"". Well, both sides most certainly do not.

Many of the leading Republicans may be orders of magnitude more so, but there is clearly an element of anti-compromise and antipolitics in Bernie too.  For one, he was an Independent rather than a party member for many years, separating himself from a key part of our political system.  In addition, he has policy positions that don’t attempt to take into account those with differences in opinion.  Case in point is single-payer health insurance.  Wouldn’t be it better to acknowledge that there are many, perhaps even a majority of Americans, that don’t want this, and propose a public option instead, testing the waters and allowing more people to get what they want now?

This is outright anarchy!  On the other hand, Donald Trump is running as the consummate deal maker while waving his book ""The Art of the Deal.""  Mr. Trump is a true believer that you have to deal with all types to get anything done--the very essence of politics.  And that is why, the ideologically rigid Republican establishment that has stricken the word ""compromise"" from their vocabulary is hysterical about his looming candidacy.

They do not want to be involved in the process, they want their powerful leader to solve their problems for them.  This willingness, or this desire, to sit passively while your strongman leader attacks those you dislike and promises to fix everything for you is most certainly a threat to the core ideas of democracy.<br/><br/>Trump is most dangerous because in all of his ramblings he never proposes a serious public policy.  He simply targets some individuals or some groups as the cause of ""your problems"" and promises to get take them out of the process.  In some instances he threatens direct violence, in others he simply hints at their removal or silencing.  <br/><br/>In this sense, I do not accept the comparison of Sanders and Trump.

To me, 2008 is the watershed date from which we can date the rise of politicians who unabashedly know little about the world (Sarah Palin) and who know that their disdain of facts will not present an obstacle to their rise.

But it should also be said that, for more than a few, loathing of government is an ideological position unto itself, one that has been systematically cultivated on the right to the point of being profoundly destructive of our governing institutions.<br/><br/>Did this more or less begin with Ronald Reagan telling us that government isn't the solution, it's the problem? Grover Norquist wanted to make government so small that he could drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the tub. Such anecdotes win nods of approval from many ""conservatives.""<br/><br/>The system is thereby destroyed from both ends. To be sure, there's the cycle of incompetence that reinforces contempt of government. But additionally, nobody should be surprised that politicians who hate government as a matter of ideology are not inclined to govern well.<br/><br/>I blame the political right for both of these failings. But of the two, the most unforgivable is the ideologically motivated undermining of our most important institutions, where the incompetence of government is stated a priori, and then ""proven"" through self-fulfilling, deliberate dysfunction in office. A large segment of the citizenry thus comes to believe what they've been told by the government hating ideologues, and, finally, what they see.<br/><br/>What a deeply pernicious rot.","<br/>",100000004233326

As he does so often, Mr. Brooks longs for a centrist, rational, indeed thoughtful, GOP, failing to see that we are no longer in the 1950s and 1960s. Taking a quote form the middle of his essay, if you ask the average voter which party is best described as ""[not accepting] the legitimacy of other interests and opinions, [not recognizing] restraints, [wanting] total victories for themselves and their doctrine,"" the answer will be ""Republicans."" The support of Donald Trump is not the search for a superhero, it is a response to frustration with the GOP, and yes, with the political process. To be a Trump supporter does not necessarily mean you favor authoritarianism, it can also mean that you believe the only way to fix the entire American political process is to shake it up so badly that it has to reform itself in some other way than just more ""business as usual."" I am an independent in a state where one must register with a party to vote in the primary, so I am registered Republican.

Politicians have incited peoples’ anger and fear for too long. We have been allowing the ends to justify the means for too long.

While it appears to be working both ways and bad behavior certainly leads to a spiral of more bad behavior I think that if you stand back and look at this disturbing phenomenon through a historical lens you may come to some very uncomfortable conclusions. When Rep. Preston Brooks nearly beat Senator Charles Sumner to death with a walking cane over a speech that Sumner gave in 1856 opposing the spread of slavery into Bleeding Kansas it presaged the resolution of underlying differences in a bloody civil war following the election of Abraham Lincoln four years later. Did ill-tempered behavior produce a civil war or were there irreconcilable social differences that produced both that behavior and the subsequent war. David Brooks' appeals for moderation, an appeal that may have worked in decades past, may be missing the fundamental galloping change in social conditions that motivates POTUS candidates to call each other liars and threaten protesters with a punch in the face.

At the debate Rubio was hectoring Trump to lay out his healthcare policy and Trump may not have been forthcoming on steps 1, 2 and 3 but he stated an end goal - nobody dies in the streets in America and that hospitals will have to take care of these people. At this time Trump doesn't have to answer the question ""who pays for these people?"" - he just needs to lay out his principle and the policy to implement this principle can come if he gets elected.

Despite the ravings of economists, furthermore, it simply isn’t true that what benefits the very rich automatically benefits the rest of society as well; quite the contrary, in the blind obsession with personal gain that drives the plutocratic system, the plutocrats generally lose track of the hard fact that too much profiteering can run the entire system into the ground  A democracy in its terminal years thus devolves into a broken society from which only the narrowing circle of the privileged rich derive any tangible benefit.

17704678,"The Republican Party is no longer a political party; it is an insurrection. The latest action in the battle, the refusal to consider the presidents nomination for the Supreme Court, is just the most recent in a long list of tactics designed to delegitimize not only the presidency of Mr. Obama but government itself. This bloodless coup is funded and supported by the most anti-democratic elements of our society, right-wing media and a cabal of billionaires.<br/><br/>Trump isn't an outsider in this, he is the consequence. When government is corrupted from the outside and eroded from the inside it opens the door to dictatorship and at least two of the front running Republicans seem to be okay with that. As one wag quipped ""Trump's speeches sound better in the original German"". It was funny at the time but now it just sounds ominous.<br/><br/>Mr. Brooks has tried to conflate Trump and Sanders. This is perplexing since Sanders is actually the antidote to the problems mentioned in this column. I don't know if he would be a good president; I don't imagine he would have any greater success with the rebels in congress than Mr. Obama had; but the the things Sanders is saying need to be said. There has to be a counterbalance to the proto-fascist rantings of Trump et al.<br/><br/>This election has been characterized on the left as an election to save the country. This may be true but I'm afraid that like the Obama presidency it will only be a speed bump on the road to the ultimate victory of big money.","<br/>",100000004233326
17703737," The diversity to which Brooks refers serves as a source of both strengths and weaknesses in our system.  The more diverse a population, in terms of interests, religion and culture, the more difficulties political leaders face in forming coalitions to govern in ways that satisfy their constituencies.  The very complexity of the alliances encourages candidates to imitate chameleons in an effort to appeal to all elements of their party.  This balancing act fosters cynicism among voters, who observe that their representatives cannot keep such a variety of promises.<br/><br/>At the same time, our diversity protects the political system from the rise of tyrants.  James Madison argued that this multiplicity of interests, combined with the geographical immensity of the country, would defeat any effort to consolidate power in the hands of a small group of people.  Americans' sense of unity, except in times of crisis, might remain loose, but no dictator would ever rule them.<br/><br/>This reality helps explain why a malfunction of our system more closely resembles anarchy than tyranny.  Trump, to be sure, boasts of his future achievements, but victory in November would soon enough emasculate him.  Cruz, more realistically, presents himself as a champion who defeats his enemies by shutting down the government, so they cannot further damage the country.<br/><br/>Only a willingness to compromise can end this deadlock.

Yesterday I received a call to tell me that an important medical procedure that was scheduled back in November had been cancelled by my insurance company. When I called the exchange for help I was told that the computers are down for ""repairs"" until next week so the procedure scheduled for Monday will have to be rescheduled.

We are not through this yet.<br/><br/>There is a fundamental difference however between the Civil Rights era and today -- it was over rights for a distinct minority that had been very badly oppressed, yet virtually all the violence and nullification was from the oppressors, not willing to give up their ""peculiar institutions."" <br/><br/>Our current outrage and disfunction is the cultural descendants of those oppressors who are not yet a minority, but becoming so.<br/><br/>This is all about the long slow process of whites becoming only another minority among the range of ethnic/racial/cultural/religious stew that is America -- rage over loss of privilege is mixed with rage over financial ruin and loss of opportunity among the broad range of the lower middle class.

Several generations ago, the Theys lived in a US where straight white men held virtually all positions of power in government, commerce, academia, the military and the church; where an SWM without a college degree could comfortably support a wife who stayed home to raise the kids; and where it was largely assumed that this was the natural order. The ground started shifting sometime in the late 50s, and the Theys began to grow resentful and fearful. A minority political party, dedicated to keeping the country safe for capitalism, sensed an opportunity and developed a strategy for attracting They votes by speaking to these fears and resentments. Where we are today is the natural progression of this strategy, which continues to be deployed while the ground keeps shifting. But we aren't at a culmination.

During the past 70 years the nation has had only two, possibly three, Presidents who communicated effectively with the electorate: FDR, JFK and perhaps, Reagan.

It seems all the masks of politics are coming off, all the ideals such as democracy, rights, communism, what have you and instead the argument is turning to actual and naked discussion of interests pure and simple, right and left wing economics, how to satisfy in simple basics the restless masses of millions upon millions of people, everything else, not to mention culture, just collapsing in a crowd discussion of who gets what, when, where, why, and how.<br/><br/>The open boat.","<br/>",100000004233326

However much David Brooks says he wants politics and not authoritarianism, what he has said and written over the past number of years often has often seemed to me to be infused with undue deference to authority and with a firm assumption that politics may be engaged in by only some people, the right people, the people of the right ilk, people like himself, people who possess some characteristic or other which I find irrelevant.  So I take issue with any idea that the previous era of conservative politics was a good thing and worked well, even within the universe of people who consider themselves conservatives.  While the current group of Republican presidential candidates may amplify the flaws in the GOP and conservatism, I think they were there before.  I think most especially the flaw that only people to the manor born should have power and influence, and that everybody else should defer to their authority has been present even in the columnist.

It requires us to listen to each other, argue with each other, curse at each other, find common ground  with each  other, and, ultimately, learn from each other. That’s the<br/>beauty of our system – although it can sometimes feel less than beautiful. But when compared to the alternatives, it surely is  beautiful. Democracy  emphasizes  the  interconnectedness  of  people,  the  common  interest  that  we  share  in everyone’s life working out as best as God will allow. Think about it. The better your neighbor’s life works out, the less  of  a  burden  he  or  she  will  ever  be  on  you. And  inasmuch  as  our  50  states  share  a  collective  roof  that extends  from  sea  to  shining  sea,  we  are  inescapably  neighbors – neighbors  albeit  in  a  vast,  spiritually  diverse, multi-ethnic, multi-racial village called America.

From his tiny bubbling brook (think the Mississippi River rising in Minnesota) came the rushing tide of Newt Gingrich, Tom DeLay, Dick Armey, Lee Atwater, Karl Rove, Pat Buchanan, W's complete failure (led by Dick  Cheney), culminating in today's nightmare of Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, the now-departed John Boehner and the cast of 17 clowns clamoring to be your party's presidential nominee. Your Republican Congress has spent the last seven years in a non-stop campaign to de-legitimize the black president. See, for just a few particulars: ""one-term president;"" the birther movement; Joe ""you lie!"" Wilson's racist dog-whistle at President Obama's very first SOTU address; Boehner's invitation to Bibi. The cult of ""antipolitics"" is now loose in the land. You lament ""trampling customs and rules that give legitimacy to legislative decision-making."" The serial votes to repeal the ACA. Ted ""Canadian Club"" Cruz shuttering the government. Sarah Palin. Repealing voting rights. Gerrymandering. McConnell's defiance of the Constitution.

We have a Republican Party that long ago ceased to be the party of Lincoln and Eisenhower. In this model, even a liberal can find something to like in an outsider such as Donald Trump. After all, he is opposed to military interventions in foreign civil wars, opposed to ""free trade"", and takes no money from Super PACS. (He also supports a version of Obamacare, but does not realize it yet. You cannot get insured for pre-existing conditions unless there is a mandate, otherwise everyone would wait until they are sick before they get insurance.)<br/><br/>But there is an even better alternative to our corrupt and rigged system, and that involves electing Bernie Sanders and new members of Congress who think like him.

It lacked diversity and was not very informative or interesting. Rehashing the same points over and over has a limited shelf life, and at that time of day, there were other things to do that were more interesting. Frankly, MSNBC had become so liberal that it wasn't really liberal, any more. When the Rev. Al Sharpton has his own show, you had to wonder what was that all about. It was like he was his own news. The Ed Show, actually, was the best of all, since it was diverse, current, and informative. As well, it was a great platform to learn about Bernie for example, but they played around with Ed, too.

Remember, Beyonce's latest single and video were apparently so inflammatory that a police chief, whose house was apparently shot at, actually blamed it as a possible incitement. Some cops griped about providing security for her. SNL had a hilarious and somewhat dismaying skit about white Americans freaking out in terror as they learned that ""Beyonce's BLACK?!"" Believe it or not, these are interesting, dynamic, and - yes - worthwhile discussions to have, all the more so within the context of broader, ongoing discussions of race, policing, and inequality.)<br/>MHP is as imperfect as any of us, and personally I have disagreed strongly with her at times.

But that was the old MSNBC, when it thought it could be the cable outlet for a hoped for audience of millions and millions of progressives. That audience never materialized, and it was always dead last among cable news. It still is, but becoming worthwhile watching for real news and analysis. MSNBC has a history of dumping hosts and contributors for minor verbal offenses. They had an opportunity to remove MHP from their roster some years ago, when she ridiculed Mitt Romney's family for having a black grandchild. Now that MHP has walked away from her show, MSNBC should thank her for her service, and fill her slot with a less egocentric host.

As a host of a show (her own, or when she is subbing for Rachel Maddow, for example), she suffers from a woodenness that comes with reading a teleprompter.  Chris Hayes is a similar case.  They are two BRILLIANT people who need to be caught in the act of conversing in order to truly draw and attract a loyal base.  Rachel is the perfect example of someone who reads the teleprompter, but keeps it fresh, alive, and interesting.  UP! with Chris Hayes was a wonderful program, because there was no script.  In terms of the ""lack of interest"" in MHP, I quite believe that were she a more talented reader of written language (an actress, as it were), she would have a larger and more fiercely devoted fan base.  When she first came on the scene as a guest, I couldn't get enough of her.  When she got her own show, I stopped watching after 3 or 4 weeks.  I am quite looking forward to Joy Reid.

I did not catch anything in the article about her shows ratings were which should be the objective criteria used and in fairness what is used to make decisions. <br/><br/>As to MSNBC as a whole, the new format has not been as some early articles implied a wholesale turn away from the left which is good.

17716735,"I notice that all the media organizations pre-empt and eventually cut the shows with hosts of color, like Dr. Harris-Perry, who feature nonwhite guests and who regularly explore social justice, race and inequality.  As long as they just put a face of color affirming the centrality of issues and views of white culture and white concerns, they can stay forever (Sue Simmons, Don Lemon et al). If they insist on putting the spotlight on the views and voices of outstanding people of color, their ratings mysteriously falter.  Even though we know that the proportion of whites in the US is decreasing, the media doesn't see the value in figuring out how to help whites cultivate interest in the increasingly majority-minorities reality of the US.  It isn't immediately profitable; they would rather keep projecting what has been the status quo. When nonwhites explode onto the news, there is always a scramble for talking heads of color to explain what just happened.  Because, white folks thought everything was fine, listening to their own echo chamber, focused on their own concerns, fiddling while Rome burns. Note how many commenters here said they never heard of MHP or her show; and that means to their conceited minds that she deserves to be booted off.  Unfortunately, it is ominous for all of us - whites and nonwhites, because the history (Tulsa, Atlanta, Rosewood, etc) is that when white folks wake up to having missed out, they are the ones who riot and burn down everything.

No one else is. <br/><br/>It's hard to believe that Saturday &amp; Sunday mornings were so important to ratings that the network execs felt the need to preempt MHP regularly. They hid Al Sharpton on Sunday mornings from 8:00-9:00. Was 10:00-12:00 so much more important to ratings that an intelligent, educated black woman wasn't good enough for them?<br/><br/>I'm a white liberal from NC.

It really is difficult now to distinguish sometimes between them and Fox Noise.  The promotion of Trump giving him  disproportionate airtime is off the charts. With this makeover of their lineup, there is now essentially no station, no home for a democratic point of view.  I suspect the remaining liberal hosts will be picked off one by one until they are all gone in favor of people endorsing the myth of the false equivalence between the two parties, that they both do it, are both awful, etc when it is in fact the right that does all kinds of horrible things that dems on the left do not do.  Net result?  Another station promoting the super minority party, the republicans, so the corporate owners, the 1% can keep the smoke and mirrors games going to keep the right in power.

17716671,"Melissa Harris-Perry and her show are both insufferable. She lost me years ago with her ""ticking clock"" segment on the scumbag Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma who had a botched execution and died on the gurney of a heart attack. She said from the outset she wasn't going to discuss the details of the crime. Perry instead preferred to somehow turn a heinous crime (and a merciful death compared to what Lockett meted out on his victim) and instead make a point about race because the murderer was black. I suppose the point was to conflate Ferguson with this crime and to show how racist the system is, as if intelligent people can't tell the difference. Lockett and his companion kidnapped, beat, and shot a 19 year old girl and when she still wasn't dead, they buried her alive and stood there for several minutes taunting her until they knew she had died. So Perry sat there with a clock ticking to represent how long it took Lockett to die from the execution which was apparently incorrectly administered. Where was the clock for Stephanie Neiman - the girl they mercilessly and cruelly slaughtered? I'll be glad to watch a more competent, responsible alternative on MSNBC weekend mornings. I don't care what color they are. I care how responsible they are as TV  Anchors/news commentators. Perry? Good riddance.

MHP also provided a perspective - part professor, part cultural observer, part nerd - that can be challenging to find in any mainstream media form.<br/>(I'm a little surprised by those who scoff at her discussion about Beyonce's video and performance as though they were unworthy and rightfully preempted by yet another recycled stump speech. Remember, Beyonce's latest single and video were apparently so inflammatory that a police chief, whose house was apparently shot at, actually blamed it as a possible incitement. Some cops griped about providing security for her. SNL had a hilarious and somewhat dismaying skit about white Americans freaking out in terror as they learned that ""Beyonce's BLACK?!"" Believe it or not, these are interesting, dynamic, and - yes - worthwhile discussions to have, all the more so within the context of broader, ongoing discussions of race, policing, and inequality.)<br/>MHP is as imperfect as any of us, and personally I have disagreed strongly with her at times.

There was more, including a horrid flash back to her youth, but still not one word of threat, not one actual gesture and no weapon of any kind except what she said he 'might' have had and was unseen.  Then today's episode. She tell the NY Times she did NOT feel this issue was race related but sends a letter to her followers that includes:  I am not a token, mammy, or little brown bobble head.

Tamron Hall is a star at the network.  I don't think anyone on MNSBC has a higher trust score than Eugene Robinson.

17716783,"While I don't always agree with Dr. Melissa Harris-Perry or her guests, I can saw without hesitation that her show provides a valuable and distinctive take on the serious issues of the day. She has explored issues involving women, working-class and poor people, blacks and latinos, and so much more, in a fashion that prioritizes substantive conversation over the sensational he said-she said, horse race reporting that dominates TV news. Losing her show would and should register as a serious problem for MSNBC.<br/><br/>Chasing the news isn't going to turn MSNBC around and lead it to a position in front of Fox News, let alone CNN. Dropping the liberal shows in favor of ""hard news"" may sound like a good idea, but MSNBC betrays its lack of vision by bringing a disgraced dissembler like Brian Williams on the air. What on earth are they thinking with that? This man couldn't be bothered to tell the truth again and again, yet he gets to sit in front of a camera and Dr. Harris-Perry can't?<br/><br/>As for Trump, some of us saw early on that the elite consensus about the man was completely wrong. The experiences of social, political and business elites have long been diverging from what the rest of the country is going through. Doesn't anyone grasp what that 99% means or how it resonated in 2012? It's not a joke; Trump (and Sanders) recognizes this, but wealthy, highly educated, privileged elites don't.

I find Ms Maddow must better informed and a more interesting reporter and discussion leader than Mr. Todd. I do not watch him on the Sunday morning shows. But apparently Mr. Todd and Brian, the disgraced lying reporter, have coopted the ladies beause the men are better at news.<br/><br/>Unless the ladies can figure out a way to draw more viewers, they are going to be sidelined. I think this was a poorly considered decision by Ms. Harris-Perry. Not showing up to do her show was useless and unprofessional. What she should have suggested was a viable alternative for MSNBC - because if she can't figure one out, she's not going to be around much longer anyhow. Exiting this way will make it difficult for her to get hiared at any other network.","<br/>",100000004236180

He has done what I and so many others have wanted somebody out there with money and name recognition to do--expose as a sham, joke, and farce the wholly inconsistent and contradictory ""conservative"" agenda of bloated government welfare for the military and corporations, Social Darwinism for the working class, the hollowing out of American industry in the name of ""free"" trade, forced birth for girls and women, and so on and so forth.

She is smart and talented with a show that features guest and important conversations that are not necessarily mainstream, but should be. <br/><br/>I used to watch MSNBC but have watched it morph into a less liberal network. I can barley watch morning Joe. MSNBC has had a role as much as any network with giving Donald Trump a free pass on his erratic and dishonest past and plenty of free press to denigrate others while always puffing himself with pompous pride. He hardly answers a question and Joe, Mika and the whole crew just toss softball after softball-- with the exception of one morning when Joe could not control himself (well, there have been many mornings of that).<br/><br/>The way that MSNBC turned the tables on many of the news programs was disappointing and some of the shows that have replaced them have very boring personalities in the seats. Something that MHP definitely is not. I'd like to read the letter that she'd write to MSNBC. She feels she has been treated unjustly. No word from Lack, et al. Very poor professionalism. Yet, that is how the industry flows-- it changes whenever it feels like it and its mostly white male ethos-- now that Obama is leaving office shortly, is perhaps portraying they want to take their station back.

It is the time when permutated a few bytes of information are then stretched by multiple talking heads who sadly do not add anything of value.

And in this day and age, I believe it's time for a talking head broadcast that delved into the Black Experience in a 60/40 format kind of way. And with a presentation like i just mentioned, female/male/African American seems like a fit to me. <br/><br/>So, who am I and what do I know? Not much!

There are primaries on the weekends now, or on Tuesdays, and this election has become the biggest reality show on television, and is being marketed that way.

His work on the visit of Pope Francis was exceptional. He has an air of authority which comes across as secure in his ability to do his job. However, MSNBC does have a new scandal which is just now starting to bring attention to itself. As documented by Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone magazine, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, hosts of ""Morning Joe"" have become regarded as shills for the Trump campaign and were recently recorded off camera during a ""townhall"" event behaving very chummily with the candidate.

Early on they gave almost unlimited time to Trump speeches and yet, did not afford the same coverage to other candidates (do we need to bring back the equal time rule?). For some reason, they also feel the need to replay the same clips over and over from the debate we all watched the night before. If they are targeting those of us who enjoy our politics, might it not be assumed that we have already seen the footage? Why do I need Chris Hayes, Rachel and Lawrence O'Donnell to repeat the same clip within their respective, back to back programs? And, finally, their Morning Joe program has simply become unwatchable. Whereas four years ago you could usually find a balanced discussion, presently, the program touts Trump (it was Christie before he tanked), manages to turn any negative back on Hillary or Obama, offers a constant diatribe (with chirping from the sidelines that have no value) and harbors little patience for guests from either side of the aisle who may disagree.

Shame on Chris Matthews for even participating in one of them. As for the other--Scarborough and Breszinski's craven ""Town Hall"" with Trump that was more like a fan-club meeting--well, shame on everyone involved. <br/><br/>So, yeah, Griffin/Lack think more Trump and Scarborough (not to mention the recent addition of Beltway hacks Marc Halperin and John Heilman) is the key to MSNBC's salvation.

17714805,"Hmmm.  Does your comment mean AC is IN the minority (rather than BEING a minority), meaning not everyone agrees with AC's comment?  If so, perhaps that's because Harris-Perry isn't for the masses who want everything in 30 second sound-bites and can't deal with a 15-minute give-and-take discussion of the issues.

17711207,"Truth in packaging:  I turn on MSNBC by 5 daily for Chuck Todd and it is my default channel when there's no ""entertainment"" program I want to watch on networks, cable or BBC.  I am an addict. They have replaced HGTV on my always-on list.<br/>But MSNBC's political  coverage has been . . .  troubling.<br/>They ran every single rally speech Trump gave -- even when CNN cut in and out, there'd would be The Donald going on and on.<br/>Their use of bars to do their never-ending primary state coverage was impossible -- the continuous din of patrons and servers made it maddening to listen to.  I know, trying to look different from CNN . .  but too cutesy and not enough substance.<br/>Last night with two hours of Chris Hayes, who was just ragged after doing two hours live with Bernie and then straight onto post-debate coverage.<br/>Their huge stable of ""special correspondents"" (or whatever they call them) are a rag-tag assemblage of has-beens and wanna-bes, with the occasional solid performer like the Washington Post people.<br/>And please, Brian Wiliams, with his stiff news reader style, trying to manage the fast changing election night returns coverage . . . . oh dear.  Watched him stumble around one night, with Rachel who can handle anything, sort of looking sideways at him in a bit of dismay (you could see her thinking jeez, Brian, pivot).<br/>I know they're trying to be different.  Williams is a loser, give me Rachel, Chris Hayes and Kornacke and Todd.  In a studio, doing what they do best. ","<br/>",100000004236180

17711954,"Chuck Todd is an establishment shill. He has no willingness to ask hard questions. David Gregory was a MtP disaster, and Todd hasn't stopped Tim Russert from still spinning in his grave.","<br/>",100000004236180

17712352,"Kathy you have really hit it exactly right. I agree with everything you stated. Hate the constant Trump coverage and the noisy bar scene. Brian Williams is terrible, stiff and painful to watch. MHP had a pretty good show, often interesting. I don't watch during the day out here on the left coast. So happy to miss Morning Joe. When I get a chance to see some of it I find it really annoying. Does Mika ever say anything??? Steve Karnacke is so smart. Love Rachel, Lawrence, Chris Hayes. Please do something MSNBC!! Not everyone TWEETS!","<br/>",100000004236180
17715158,"I agree with the Brian Williams bit.  Seems MSNBC is trying to revive the fallen hero only for the audience to witness a man who by and large is a shadow of his former self and looks ""down in the mouth"" and depressed.  Not entertaining by a long shot.  The handsome good looks now mostly gone and the nasal voice is distracting.","<br/>",100000004236180
17716086,"Don't forget Lawrence and Chris Matthews.  On a daily basis, the MSNBC people (most particularly Rachel) dissect and debunk the Republican story line with excellent research and intelligent analysis.  I am grateful for their existence.","n/a",100000004236180
