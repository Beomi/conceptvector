When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our future. In America, every person, no matter what you look like or who you are, should have the chance to go as far as your dreams will take you. We need to come together to turn the tide, stop violence, build trust, and give all our kids the chance to grow up safe and healthy.

Apologize to the President, and to the American people. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birtherism stems from the same innate beliefs that led to discriminating against black tenants early in his career. Can\\'t be undone. The birther lie is what turned Trump from an ordinary reality TV star into a political figure. That origin story can\\'t be unwritten. Trump has spent years peddling a racist conspiracy aimed at undermining the first African American president. He can\\'t just take it back. This shouldn\\'t have to be said: You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just get to say someone else did the worst things you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. No one buys it. Again, Trump turns his faults on others. Psychologists call it \"projecting.\" Kids call it \"I\\'m rubber, you\\'re glue.\" https://t.co/lKDDD0wwsn When Trump tries to deflect blame for denying that @POTUS was born in America, he is lying. https://t.co/lje3lKrZQy https://t.co/yq9IWnvXUc Leading the birther movement is deplorable. Attempting to say it \"did a great service\" to the president who Trump attacked is asinine. Expressing zero regret for years of pushing a racist conspiracy theory, Trump again appointed himself judge &amp; jury on @POTUS\\'s citizenship. What Trump just did is a disgrace. It\\'s been 5 years, and Trump\\'s still pushing the notion that @POTUS isn\\'t American. https://t.co/TApNqSOcvN My dad was born in Poland.

America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for people who look or worship a certain way.

Will your children disclose all of the foreign trips and business deals they\\'ve undertaken during the campaign, and with whom they met? 16.

Background checks and an assault weapons ban might not stop every attack\\xe2\\x80\\x94but they\\'ll stop some, and save lives. We need to fight for them. In Orlando and San Bernardino, terrorists used assault weapons like the AR-15 to kill Americans. We should make it harder for them to do so.

Sad! \"Stay on message\" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents! I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so! It is not \"freedom of the press\" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false! I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it! Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose! My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm. If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn\\'t put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20% The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary! \"@zulu_out: You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U\" Thanks \"@PaulaDuvall2: We\\'re all enjoying you, as well, Mr. T.!

You campaign endlessly and have spent millions.We love you! #TrumpTrain\" Thanks I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th! The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources.

Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary? When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary\\'s pay-for-play at State Department? CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs. CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton. Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno, Nevada- tonight at 7pm! Tickets available at: https://t.co/4nLjRGyFYw #CrookedHillary \\nhttps://t.co/oHI6xrDJU0 So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That\\'s what I said! When I said in an interview that Putin is \"not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down,\" I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea! This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart! Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice! Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable! \"@RealJamesWoods:  Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn\\'t stand a chance. #VoterFraud and #MSM her only hope.\" The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H? I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me! Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our \"leaders\" to eradicate it! Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you! Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.

It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNews NATO commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer:\\nhttps://t.co/VZLDFy707K Wow, NATO\\'s top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like! The \"Rust Belt\" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END! Crooked\\'s stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP #CrookedHillary = Obama\\'s third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. https://t.co/y9WJoUaaql Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA? I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better! Why doesn\\'t the media want to report that on the two \"Big Thursdays\" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican\\'s won ratings #CrookedHillary https://t.co/xyoPFJmByp Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster! Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities. Just got back from Colorado.

Join me live in Toledo, Ohio!\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\nhttps://t.co/ruEvMGx4C9 #CrookedHillary https://t.co/lwi9gqDEHE Thank you Pennsylvania!\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain \\nhttps://t.co/bbv3EhGs5x https://t.co/bbroAGTdMw Thank you to our amazing law enforcement officers! #MAGA https://t.co/UEZorOQhTw \"Trump right: Illegal families crossing border set to double, 51,152 so far\"\\nhttps://t.co/1noCe9W6Ru Great new poll - thank you!\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/mXovx0TLPC If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton\\'s 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI! Join our next Vice President, @Mike_Pence in Wisconsin tonight &amp; Michigan Thursday!\\n\\nMI: https://t.co/daR2xIhCEs\\nWI: https://t.co/LKc7e4VZkB Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to \"carpet bomb\" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz! Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO! Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough! The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD! Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said \"Trump is a genius.\" America 1st! As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. \\nhttps://t.co/eoNTWK6I8y Many of Bernie\\'s supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep? I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention! No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated! You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia. In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy! Dems don\\'t want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary\\'s foreign interventions unleashed ISIS &amp; her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here. Bernie\\'s exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed! The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar! Thank you New Hampshire! \\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/KRCdV77BQp Join us in Toledo, Ohio- tomorrow night at 8pm! #TrumpPence16 #MAGA\\nTickets: https://t.co/ERNRrksikq https://t.co/zmGZauCnQF Join us tomorrow in Scranton, Pennsylvania at 3pm!\\n#TrumpPence16 #MAGA \\nTickets: https://t.co/4FTydj8s9U https://t.co/7zMKhhMmhp Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch. Why aren\\'t the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time. Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated! Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself. I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air! Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke! While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War. Thank you OHIO! #TrumpPence16\\nhttps://t.co/NOF9Td9BHs https://t.co/WPMBkYjuIm Thank you Roanoke, Virginia- be back soon! #TrumpPence16\\nhttps://t.co/rwxXhfFsn1 https://t.co/HwqI2iGPDu MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #TrumpPence16\\nhttps://t.co/4O4yjh7X4O https://t.co/cptBaZbV1v #MakeAmericaGreatAgain \\nhttps://t.co/EXsoUOsEP4 https://t.co/3ji7a14GSw Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don\\'t want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE! Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn! Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance! Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her \"servant\" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that\\'s all! They laughed at Bernie. If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie! The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America\\'s problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing! The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you! The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she\\'s out! The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well! Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don\\'t believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook! Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don\\'t watch CNN! I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.) Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can\\'t go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD! There is no longer a Bernie Sanders \"political revolution.\" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates. Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite! Wow, President Obama\\'s brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\n#TrumpPence16 https://t.co/gCzHX1nyxD \"@NancyNielsenn: @realDonaldTrump Dinesh D\\'Sousa Hillary\\'s America. see it\" \"@OliMauritania: @realDonaldTrump Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals https://t.co/0FFeKTsuJn #HillaryKaine2016\" Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart! The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud! Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don\\'t look presidential to me! I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven\\'t had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs! Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer! Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back! Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA. Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn\\'t chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her! Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing! The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight? \"@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain\" I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam. Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn\\'t get indicted while Bob M did? Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich. One of the best produced, including the incredible stage &amp; set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRove Thank you Cleveland. We love you and will be back many times! What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all.

STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECH\\nhttps://t.co/uzBOm21Pug The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania\\'s speech than the FBI spent on Hillary\\'s emails. Good news is Melania\\'s speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press! In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs! Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years. Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you! Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States.

I don\\'t watch. If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn\\'t lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud! It doesn\\'t matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement! As the days and weeks go by,  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions! We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud.

Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what\\'s happening! Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don\\'t have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start! Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P. introduction tomorrow in New York City. I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M.

Details to follow. If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions! Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking? Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge! On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others. Voters understand that Crooked Hillary\\'s negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity. Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C. Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City. Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies. Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come! The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but...https://t.co/KO64IAMDgj https://t.co/8CBSfNpl2l Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement. Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team \"were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\" Not fit! Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT! I don\\'t think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with \"murder.\" Come November 8, she\\'s out! Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm. Enjoy! My son, @EricTrump will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on @FoxNews. Enjoy! Looking forward to meeting with @SenBobCorker in a little while. We will be traveling to North Carolina together today. FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment. It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again! Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace! On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. \"Special: Meet the Trumps\" Hope you enjoy! Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays? With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won\\'t even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM! Crooked Hillary Clinton is \"guilty as hell\" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails? The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked! I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa! Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people! Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid! Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff\\'s Star, or plain star! Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst https://t.co/Ndb3AQrLtY https://t.co/YhHyQjwJW6 Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change! The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this! In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed! I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught! The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting \"go away, no pictures.\" Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about \"grandkids\" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac? \"THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!\" On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil! Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt! Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.

I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use! What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough \"@WandaWalls20: @realDonaldTrump Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble. Reporting that Orlando killer shouted \"Allah hu Akbar!\" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.

Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don\\'t want congrats, I want toughness &amp; vigilance. We must be smart! Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims &amp; their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart &amp; vigilant?

Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!

People like @KatyTurNBC report on my campaign, but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media! Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change! I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me.

News conference at 11:00 A.M. today, Trump Tower! I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me. I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!

Nice! In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary! Obama says a WALL at our southern border won\\'t enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H. If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court! The Republican Party has to be smart &amp; strong if it wants to win in November. Can\\'t allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate! Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can\\'t control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, R\\'s! Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do. Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit! Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them. Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he\\'s in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW Don\\'t believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me! I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, I\\'m in the back of the paper. Very dishonest! The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money &amp; get much better results! What we need as Prez! The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style &amp; that I don\\'t have many people. I have 73, Hillary has 800- &amp; I\\'m beating her. I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.

Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can\\'t believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. \"You can tell them to go BLANK themselves\" - was about China, NOT WOMEN! Wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run? \"@AprilLaJune: OREGON votes today! Go vote for @realDonaldTrump and kick it BIG TIME! https://t.co/SLYwyM8w1D\" What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. I said no.

Shows how weak and desperate Lyin\\' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can\\'t stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. Lyin\\' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness! Lyin\\' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp; special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad! Wow, just announced that Lyin\\' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION! I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing.

Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out! Lyin\\' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me.

We need strong borders now! Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.

He is not as smart as Cruz, and may be an even bigger liar .#RogerStone was just banned by @CNN - their loss! Tough, loyal guy. I started my business with very little and built it into a great company, with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing! I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn\\'t - total fabrication! Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people! I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz! Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit, no problem! I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why? \"@NeilTurner_: @realDonaldTrump There\\'s only one real candidate, and it\\'s you!

Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor! Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material! Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed! Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made! Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!

Keep it up &amp; you\\'ll have this Democrats vote.\" Watch @AC360 on NOW! @CNN I will be interviewed by Anderson Cooper at 8pm on @CNN from New Hampshire. Should be very interesting! Taking a helicopter to New Hampshire, boarding now. Amazing activity planned. New UMASS poll, very nice! https://t.co/xFvGE0dRlA Politicians are trying to chip away at the 2nd Amendment.

Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa, with each candidate moving up one notch. Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn\\'t want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat! THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock, Arkansas tonight!

The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud! This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud https://t.co/tRM7KUCrSU I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and \"choice\" - a total lie! The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. Ted Cruz didn\\'t win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd! \\n#FITN #Trump2016 \\nhttps://t.co/oUg1ErD0j7 https://t.co/9Hb7JO3wrZ Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz\\'s far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment! \"@stephbewitching @realDonaldTrump All you haters need to realize Trump got the second highest vote in history. And he\\'s never held office!\" \"@restorereality  Iowa is meaningless...keep pushing forward, run the table in NH SC NV and Super Tuesday.

Smart for @MarcoRubio to keep his speech short &amp; sweet. Ditto for @realDonaldTrump who was brief &amp; gracious. I don\\'t believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it! I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history! Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz &amp; Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn\\'t do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice CEDAR RAPIDS --\\n\\nTRUMP\\'S DAUGHT IVANKA:\\n\\n\"I can just say without equivocation, my father will make America great again.\" Sat down w/ @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr here in Iowa.

Enjoy! I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos  this morning. ENJOY! If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000. By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing \"unfairness\" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS. Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal &amp; replace. He lies! Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam! Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN! I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State! .@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn\\'t give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed Cruz. @foxandfriends .@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends .@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz! The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters \"in violation.\" They are now under investigation. Bad!

Amazing that Ted Cruz can\\'t even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted! .@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?  @greta The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols. The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn\\'t report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate. The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife\\'s employer, and his lender, is located there! Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer! Ted Cruz said he \"didn\\'t know\" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago.

Apologize to the President, and to the American people. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birtherism stems from the same innate beliefs that led to discriminating against black tenants early in his career. Can\\'t be undone. The birther lie is what turned Trump from an ordinary reality TV star into a political figure. That origin story can\\'t be unwritten. Trump has spent years peddling a racist conspiracy aimed at undermining the first African American president. He can\\'t just take it back. This shouldn\\'t have to be said: You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just get to say someone else did the worst things you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. No one buys it.

When Trump was getting his start in business, he was sued by the Justice Dept. for refusing to rent apartments to black and Latino tenants. Trump is reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters. Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia.

I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so! It is not \"freedom of the press\" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false! I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it! Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose! My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.

The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life. Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary? When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary\\'s pay-for-play at State Department? CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs. CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton. Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno, Nevada- tonight at 7pm! Tickets available at: https://t.co/4nLjRGyFYw #CrookedHillary \\nhttps://t.co/oHI6xrDJU0 So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That\\'s what I said! When I said in an interview that Putin is \"not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down,\" I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea! This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart! Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice! Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable! \"@RealJamesWoods:  Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn\\'t stand a chance. #VoterFraud and #MSM her only hope.\" The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H? I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me! Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our \"leaders\" to eradicate it! Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you! Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS. Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNews NATO commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer:\\nhttps://t.co/VZLDFy707K Wow, NATO\\'s top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like! The \"Rust Belt\" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END! Crooked\\'s stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP #CrookedHillary = Obama\\'s third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. https://t.co/y9WJoUaaql Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA? I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better! Why doesn\\'t the media want to report that on the two \"Big Thursdays\" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican\\'s won ratings #CrookedHillary https://t.co/xyoPFJmByp Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster! Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities. Just got back from Colorado.

No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. Hillary\\'s wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world. Hillary\\'s vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street! Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. Hillary\\'s refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country. Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO! Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough! The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD! Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said \"Trump is a genius.\" America 1st! As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. \\nhttps://t.co/eoNTWK6I8y Many of Bernie\\'s supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep? I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention! No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated! You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia. In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy! Dems don\\'t want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary\\'s foreign interventions unleashed ISIS &amp; her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here. Bernie\\'s exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!

Sad to watch. Why aren\\'t the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time. Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated! Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself. I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air! Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke! While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn! Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance! Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her \"servant\" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that\\'s all! They laughed at Bernie. If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie! The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America\\'s problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing! The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you! The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she\\'s out! The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well! Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don\\'t believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook! Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don\\'t watch CNN! I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.) Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can\\'t go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD! There is no longer a Bernie Sanders \"political revolution.\" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates. Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite! Wow, President Obama\\'s brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\\n#TrumpPence16 https://t.co/gCzHX1nyxD \"@NancyNielsenn: @realDonaldTrump Dinesh D\\'Sousa Hillary\\'s America. see it\" \"@OliMauritania: @realDonaldTrump Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals https://t.co/0FFeKTsuJn #HillaryKaine2016\" Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart! The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud! Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don\\'t look presidential to me! I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven\\'t had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs! Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer! Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back! Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA. Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn\\'t chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her! Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing! The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight? \"@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain\" I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam. Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn\\'t get indicted while Bob M did?

How many law enforcement and people have to...\\nhttps://t.co/pPNrzG8kEa The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close. That\\'s because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don\\'t like .@FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN, which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don\\'t watch. If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn\\'t lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud! It doesn\\'t matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement! As the days and weeks go by,  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions! We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it\\'s over Thank you to Jack Morgan, Tamara Neo, Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia. GREAT JOB! \"@TrumpDoonbeg: Great news!

I will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Thank you! #TrumpPence16 https://t.co/RHprMCsGT6 Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes! Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money! Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what\\'s happening! Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don\\'t have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start! Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V.P. introduction tomorrow in New York City. I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate. News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A.M. Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O &amp; Hillary! #NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice, France. We are with you in every way! In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow\\'s news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement. Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse. I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!

Details to follow. If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions! Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking? Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge! On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others. Voters understand that Crooked Hillary\\'s negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity. Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!! Lyin\\' Crooked Hillary\\'s email stories all have one thing in common. https://t.co/teoVCYXKOR Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!

Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs. #CrookedHillary is not qualified!\\nhttps://t.co/6qi7KTW43O I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out! Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry! This election is a choice between law, order &amp; safety - or chaos, crime &amp; violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need.

President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!

I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C. Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City. Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies. Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come! The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but...https://t.co/KO64IAMDgj https://t.co/8CBSfNpl2l Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement. Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team \"were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\" Not fit! Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT! I don\\'t think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with \"murder.\" Come November 8, she\\'s out! Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm. Enjoy! My son, @EricTrump will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on @FoxNews. Enjoy! Looking forward to meeting with @SenBobCorker in a little while. We will be traveling to North Carolina together today. FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment. It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again! Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace! On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. \"Special: Meet the Trumps\" Hope you enjoy! Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays? With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won\\'t even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM! Crooked Hillary Clinton is \"guilty as hell\" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails? The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked! I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa! Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people! Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid! Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff\\'s Star, or plain star! Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst https://t.co/Ndb3AQrLtY https://t.co/YhHyQjwJW6 Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change! The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this! In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed! I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught! The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting \"go away, no pictures.\" Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about \"grandkids\" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac? \"THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!\" On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil! Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt! Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know. Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it! It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged! It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!

I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest. If you want to know about Hillary Clinton\\'s honesty &amp; judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens. Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays. I am \"the king of debt.\"That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S. Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T.  They have bankrupted\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 https://t.co/1COtt0RPY7 Hillary Clinton\\'s open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe. How can Hillary run the economy when she can\\'t even send emails without putting entire nation at risk? Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as\\nSecretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs. Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She\\'s right.  Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy. I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton. Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!

I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use! What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough \"@WandaWalls20: @realDonaldTrump Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble. Reporting that Orlando killer shouted \"Allah hu Akbar!\" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade. Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn\\'t he should immediately resign in disgrace! Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don\\'t want congrats, I want toughness &amp; vigilance. We must be smart! Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims &amp; their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart &amp; vigilant? Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame! Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded. Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career.

Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW Don\\'t believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me! I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, I\\'m in the back of the paper. Very dishonest! The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money &amp; get much better results! What we need as Prez! The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style &amp; that I don\\'t have many people. I have 73, Hillary has 800- &amp; I\\'m beating her. I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you. The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice, but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH Great rally in Fresno, California- great crowd!

Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement! I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great! Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media. Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.

Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name? Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I\\'m driving her nuts. Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me. Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy. Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s records to see if she is Native American. I say she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fraud!

When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now. Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women\\'s card - it is sad! Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn\\'t inherit it, I won it with millions of voters! \"@Ausbiz:  Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain\" So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan!

See you soon. #Trump2016 \\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest \"pushpolls\" on me. We are watching! Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance! He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN\\'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT .@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize! Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability! There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser! I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local! THANK YOU- Clemson, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #SCPrimary https://t.co/FgACmaFxxc \"@HARyder: Which is it @realDonaldTrump ?Are you planning on getting rid of Common Core or keeping it?  Get rid of it fast. I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core. Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd! So funny, Jeb Bush called me a \"highly gifted politician and a great entertainer\" - I assume that is a compliment! Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today. Like the worthless @NYDailyNews, looks like @politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money, no cred! Worthless @NYDailyNews, which dopey Mort Zuckerman, is desperately trying to sell, has no buyer! Liabilities are massive!

I know the \"Governors\" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!

This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud https://t.co/tRM7KUCrSU I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and \"choice\" - a total lie! The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. Ted Cruz didn\\'t win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job.

There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal &amp; replace. He lies! Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam! Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN! I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State! .@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man.

Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn\\'t report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate. The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife\\'s employer, and his lender, is located there! Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer! Ted Cruz said he \"didn\\'t know\" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago.

Thank @ericbolling - great guy! \"@GeraldoRivera @SenTedCruz got ass kicked by @realDonaldTrump last night-He offended every New Yorker &amp; has no answer to Natural Born issue Jusr watched  #HarveyPitt on @TeamCavuto - he was great! @DonaldJTrumpJr @Reryan08 @IvankaTrump @EricTrump obvious to all that he raised some GREAT, responsible, patriotic kids.  Kudos Donald SR Top searched candidate by state, as seen in the #GOPDebate media filing center. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/nwKPRmWFNr Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush. Jeb Bush, who did poorly last night in the debate and whose chances of winning are zero, just got Graham endorsement. Graham quit at O.

Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors? Our country was humiliated. \"@Bonfiredesigns: Standing with @realDonaldTrump as he defends our sailors and military and Americans in the USA https://t.co/YKvKNsZmih\" \"@melindaross123: @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump There isn\\'t anything Donald Trump says that I don\\'t agree with.

Won\\'t be that way if I win! Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures &amp; images. We are weak. I will NOT forget! Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does @andersoncooper put him on? Why does @CNN &amp; @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show? .@EricTrump- unbelievable job on #FoxNews with @greta. That was better than I could do! #Trump2016 THANK YOU! #VoteTrump \\nhttps://t.co/y7pnMqCs7j THANK YOU, IOWA!

Don\\'t release money. We want our hostages back NOW! Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters! The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast! Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great. The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch! The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn\\'t we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU New CBS poll. #Trump2016\\nhttps://t.co/sFPRHHeLbd Another new Iowa poll just released. Thank you! #IACaucus #FITN https://t.co/RGkrruqpM7 Such a serious problem for Ted &amp; the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let\\'s all work together to solve this problem. https://t.co/cNl6dmFb6q On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa! THANK YOU! #Trump2016 https://t.co/QmDcCKppEu The Tonight Show begins in 5 minutes. Enjoy! .@stuartpstevens horrible advise to Mitt Romney made victory an impossibility. Don\\'t blame Mitt! Now Stevens can\\'t get a job! \"@CLewandowski_: .@stuartpstevens --failed \"strategist\" who can\\'t find clients criticizes winning #TeamTrump. Stop complaining &amp; try winning Fantastic job on @CNN  tonight. @kayleighmcenany is a winner! @donlemon Don\\'t forget to watch The Tonight Show with the wonderful @jimmyfallon at 11:30 P.M. You will not be disappointed!  @NBC Face The Nation\\'s interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years. Congratulations and WOW!  @CBSNews @jdickerson .@MajorCBS Major Garrett of @CBSNews covers me very inaccurately. Total agenda, bad reporter! Thank you Michael Harrison @Talkersmagazine for your kind words - greatly appreciated! Will be on @FallonTonight with @JimmyFallon on @NBC at 11:35pmE. Enjoy! #Trump2016 https://t.co/Z9zbKfXJqb .@megynkelly recently said that she can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her! New Iowa poll.

Thank you to all of my supporters!\\n#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/KSguIhkIwa So professional of @ABC news to throw out the failing @UnionLeader newspaper from their debate. Paper won\\'t survive, highly unethical! Great job on Fox this morning @KatiePavlich. I am sending out for your book immediately. Thank you very much! Congratulations to my friend @TheSlyStallone on winning a #GoldenGlobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special- well deserved! Why does @ThisWeekABC w/ @GStephanopoulos allow a hater &amp; racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? @ABC can do much better than him! Thank you to our law enforcement officers! #LESM #Trump2016 https://t.co/sfuuVrx33E Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher! UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren\\'t worthy of representing the great people NH. This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed. If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win. I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. https://t.co/DL8hDPzHoi Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch... Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over! In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn\\'t even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding! \"@redletter99: Trump pummels his opponents - and the press | SunHerald @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/9MQhOSpiWa\"  Thank you! I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday! Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy! I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in! I\\'m protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn\\'t give them the right to be involved! (2/2) David brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal! Read it! \\nhttps://t.co/9n5CCrefKn (1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had. Thank you so much. Earnest must have been a great person. https://t.co/2DZp7YOadj https://t.co/2YtLlEwceB .@JonahNRO, watched on @seanhannity and appreciate your statements --- I have been waiting for them for a long time. Thank you. Thank you, @TheFix- Chris Cillizza. It is a true person of character that can change his opinion &amp; do what is right. https://t.co/0VxlT9iEbr Constitutional law expert  #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says \"wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn\\'t settled). South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it! Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time! Great even in SC tonight! Fire Marshall would not let everyone in-- 5,000 turned away.

I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t compete! I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let them sell you out! On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it! Not good news for Jeb Bush  https://t.co/5CrP5zdXsz Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money! \"@rlbenney: @realDonaldTrump You did great and showed courage going to Burlington.

Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara! The @TheView @ABC, once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad! Explosive Trump attack on HRC, Bill, Monica, Cosby, and Weiner. Trump camp just upped the ante on \"women\\'s rights\" https://t.co/tTBhyX4EDJ Hillary and her friends! https://t.co/q45tTapqMI Weak &amp; ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising! I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don\\'t be ashamed of it! .@SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now &amp; seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win! Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early! Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART! I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted! .@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&amp;P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott. The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate! Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received: https://t.co/NucdHBZAH9 I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET. Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come, first serve. Arrive early! Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like @SamuelLJackson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s golf swing.  Not athletic. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won many club championships.
