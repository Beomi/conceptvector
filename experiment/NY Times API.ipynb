The beginning of the story takes place in the Predator ship, and (of course you guessed it) an alien pops out of the (dead) Predator King\\'s stomach. The predators haven\\'t realized that their ship is infested with blood-sucking aliens. This causes the ship to crash land in Colorado springs, and their fight rages on again!<br/><br/> The cast includes Steven Pasquale (you might recognize him from \"Rescue Me\" the FX show and, \"Six Feet Under), who plays Dallas, a detective. And, John Ortiz (who you might remember from \"American Gangster\" and, \"Miami Vice\"), who plays the character of Morales.<br/><br/> The movie consist of very odd names but, the plot is great and so is the acting. This movie in the series was defiantly better in the first one, it has action and, there is more people and lines for them in this movie. People should defiantly go to see this movie, it was worth it!',\n",

       "    u'commentBody': u'I couldn\\'t agree with Professor Diamond more.  When I was in Finland one Christmas, I commented on how lucky the country was to have such a high per capita GDP.  A friend responded, \"you know, ten percent of that is just to keep us warm, since it\\'s so cold here.\"  My friend was simply recognizing intuitively something that should be obvious:  if Finland\\'s per capita GDP is ten percent bigger than Italy\\'s, then Finland is NOT richer.  That extra spending on heat doesn\\'t contribute to art, leisure, food, or any of the rest.  In the same way, the huge waste in the US, though it makes our economy bigger, certainly doesn\\'t make us any richer.',\n",

       "    u'commentBody': u'Jared,<br/><br/>I\\'ve been a great fan of yours for many years, and enjoyed this article as always.  However it is the first time I\\'ve ever found myself disagreeing with you about something.<br/><br/>I\\'m an American who moved to Morocco 16 years ago.  Living here for many years, and being acquainted with many Europeans, I can tell you that living standards in Western Europe do NOT meet typical American standards.  I also now understand why America is consuming so much more energy (which I learned as a child in school in the 1960\\'s but only now have come to truly understand).<br/><br/>Here is one example.  One night, while walking down the stairs in a friend\\'s apartment building where the elevator had been turned off (which happens all over here, because building owners are not required to pay the elevator maintainance fees to keep their elevators running, and they also do it to save electricity costs), the lights totally went out in the stairwell, six stories up.  Almost all lights in Morocco in buildings are on timers.  so you hit the button, and it stays on only for about 30 seconds before going off.  Only if you were a regular tenant or visitor in a given building would you know where to find these buttons in the dark.  When I later complained to my British friend about this, saying, \"If that ever happened in America, the building owner would be sued in two seconds,\" her reply was, \"Oh, don\\'t you have timers on lights in America?\"  I had an instant realization about how we leave lights on in parking garages 24 hours a day, and the same in office buildings and department stores, as well as indoor malls.  None of this lighting is done here.<br/><br/>Anyway, my point is that even in Western Europe they are not consuming nearly the electricity we are in America.  But they pay for it in having FAR LESS COMFORT and CONVENIENCE.  I realized what makes our living standards in America higher is really that we are about the most COMFORTABLE and CONVENIENT country I know of (and I\\'ve been to more than most people).  It\\'s not just about the things we buy; it\\'s about the ENERGY we consume in lighting, central heating and air conditioning.<br/><br/>Anyone who wishes to reach me on this issue can email me at mlmimouna at gmail dot com.<br/><br/>',\n",

       "    u'commentBody': u'Substances that salve and cure when used in moderation sometimes poison and kill when used excessively.  Does money have a similar property?<br/><br/>That political power corrupts is a matter of universal experience.  All forms of power, including the economic, religious, military varieties, appear to lead inexorably to corruption and dissipation as history has recorded.<br/><br/>Power also seeks more of it, just as the addict seeks more of the substance with each hit.  The super-rich  continue to seek and hoard wealth far beyond all rational need.  Some of them set out to look for political power which they see as nothing more than a conversion of one currency to another.  Some of us believe such transactions are unwholesome and even dangerous.  Our political institutions and, increasingly, our judicial leadership, too, do not appear to see much that is wrong with the emerging picture.<br/><br/>If the corrupting potential of economic power is allowed to fuse with that of political power the resulting system is bound to be immeasurably corrupt.  If Michael Bloomberg (or Mitt Romney) self-finances their way into the White House or if the shadowy millionaires who swiftboated Senator John Kerry right out of the water in 2004 are allowed to ratchet up their craft we might as well shed any pretense of a democratic way of life.',\n",

       "    u'commentBody': u\"    I have read Guns, Germs, and Steel, as well as many other books trying to explain the West's advantages throughout history.  I would say that William McNiel's are better.  So I think I can speak with some relevancing on Mr Diamond's work.  However, my main complaint is not with the major premise of the op-ed.  He is basically stating current consumption equilibria as fact.  For all I know he is right;  if not in degree than certainly in magnitude.<br/><br/>    The main beef I have with this piece is one I have with many experts, and supposed experts (Mr Diamond is the former genrally speaking), is making statements like the one below in the context of absolute fact:<br/><br/>    Since Sept. 11, 2001, it has become clear that the<br/><br/>    oceans that once protected the United States no<br/><br/>    longer do so.<br/><br/>I find these statements and others like them to be simply ludicrous.  I will put forth a very simple question to prove my point.  Would you the reader feel safer if a member of the Taliban in Islamabad could WALK in a few days to New York?  I think not.  Therefor our surounding oceans make us very safe to some threats.<br/><br/>      It is, nor has it ever been, a wall of invulnerability.  If we thought that wall existed on September 10th. it was only through our ignorance of the outside world and general complacency to its _possible_ threats.<br/><br/>     A reader would have to agree that your money is safer in a bank than under your matress.  However if the bank manager leaves the vault open for half the night you might feel better sleeping on your wealth.   The oceans are our vault.  So is our navy, our airforce, and our economy and technology.  But only to the degree that we pay attention!!<br/><br/>     It is Mr. Diamond's statement like the one above and similar ones from our President that have ignored my above reasoning, maybe intentionally, and by doing so have done great harm to Amreica and our Freedoms.<br/><br/>     I am not afraid of our very real outside enemies like Al queda and the Taliban.  Because of our oceans.  Because we have the largest navy in the world.  Because they do not control an economy like ours or even one as big as a large US city.  Statements like Mr Diamond's have simply put caused America to freak out.  To make our oceans protect us we just have to PAY ATTENTION and use our many, many advantages!  When we ignore or discount our absolute economic and military superiority or cultural force projection against our enemies we do silly things like needlessly invade other nations or take away Constitutionally given rights from our citizens.   \",\n",

And one reader\\'s comments on \"mimicing an abysmal failure\", If India\\'s education were such a hige failure, then why are the US Grad programs filled with Indians? Why are your top performers, including Citi\\'s CEO indian?<br/><br/>And to Indians who complained of rote learning, you are able to respond and think clearly and write on this forum due to your ability to \"Rote- Learn\"? I dont think so. While you grown up kids complain of having to deal with corporal punishment and rote learning, i do not see  you complaining about it when you had a 3.5+ GPA in your grad schools and are programming or doing Investment Banking jobs in America. All those who complained of that factor, why dont you try getting out of your Toyotas and suburban homes and going back to India to teach? Nope, the only thing that i gather you learnt at schoo lwas to complain and well you are doing a great job.<br/><br/>Education is something we learn,  so the entire point of a comparison is going to make some dumb American and some Dumb Indian fight against each other (Higlighted here by the Editor with a a positive bias, by omitting good comments). As for me, i learnt by heart as well, had to.. its a rat race out there, and if you are to survive, you have to evolve. And I am proud of my education. I am a better fit at the place i work in and did not study Modern English in the Dark Ages as a major to work in I-Banking. ',\n",

This hotel was awarded the Quality Excellence and Torchbearer awards for the past 5 years and there is no question about service and product quality.  The best I have ever been to. If you want a great experience for dining, try their newly remolded Alamo Steakhouse Grill.  I will definately recommend to all my friends and collegues. ',\n",

       "    u'commentBody': u\"An insightful and informative article, and one which needs to be widely read, I think.<br/><br/>I'd like to echo the comment from Hungary (no.14) about the lack of awareness among many Americans of how their standard of living actually compares to other Western countries, including many which have significantly different political and economic policies, including those which affect the environment.<br/><br/>From my (outsiders') reading of US media, I'm frequently struck by the rarely-challenged received wisdom that the US enjoys the highest standard of living in the world.  Not only do the figures not support this - as Professor Diamond makes clear with respect to Western Europe - but my own very unscientific and anecdotal experiences as a regular visitor to different parts of the US seem to contradict it.  The standard of living of the average professional Americans I meet often seems lower than my own.  This is particularly noticeable to me in terms of health care, education standards and costs, vacation time, public transport and the quality of food (this last varies hugely depending on where you are in the US, of course, but away from the coasts I'm often a bit shocked by the food).<br/><br/>I suspect that much of the popular opposition to different policies for the economics of the environment in the US still springs from this unquestioned insistence that Americans currently have the best living standards in the world.  Looking seriously at how other countries organize their societies and economies is therefore assumed to suggest a decrease in standards of living.  Whereas in fact, if most Americans knew just how well their counterparts in Western Europe are living, they might be much keener to examine different policies for their own society.  Given that Americans appear to travel much less than other first-world citizens, they are unlikely to discover this for themselves - which brings the focus back to the role of the media.  Just why do I read so regularly in the American press the blithe statement that US living-standards are the highest in the world?  American journalists owe their readers more than this, and should be vigorously challenging it when politicians make the same claim.  Why don't they?\",\n",

Sooner or later someone's going to have to have the guts to address the issue directly.<br/><br/>Control of family size changes very quickly when people have access to birth control and education. It may be easier to persuade people to have fewer children than to consume less. That trend is already established in many countries, and the change came quickly.<br/><br/>As a first step, the US could reinstitute its family planning support internationally and give up the fiction that abstinence-only education actually works. Catholics also need to do something about their church's continued stand against birth control, which looks more and more immoral for many reasons.<br/><br/>When will the day come when the Pope's stand against birth control is seen as morally suspect? Soon, I hope.\",\n",

However it is the first time I\\'ve ever found myself disagreeing with you about something.<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>I\\'m an American who moved to Morocco 16 years ago.  Living here for many years, and being acquainted with many Europeans, I can tell you that living standards in Western Europe do NOT meet typical American standards.  I also now understand why America is consuming so much more energy (which I learned as a child in school in the 1960\\'s but only now have come to truly understand).<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>Here is one example.  One night, while walking down the stairs in a friend\\'s apartment building where the elevator had been turned off (which happens all over here, because building owners are not required to pay the elevator maintainance fees to keep their elevators running, and they also do it to save electricity costs), the lights totally went out in the stairwell, six stories up.  Almost all lights in Morocco in buildings are on timers.  so you hit the button, and it stays on only for about 30 seconds before going off.  Only if you were a regular tenant or visitor in a given building would you know where to find these buttons in the dark.  When I later complained to my British friend about this, saying, \\\\\"If that ever happened in America, the building owner would be sued in two seconds,\\\\\" her reply was, \\\\\"Oh, don\\'t you have timers on lights in America?\\\\\"  I had an instant realization about how we leave lights on in parking garages 24 hours a day, and the same in office buildings and department stores, as well as indoor malls.  None of this lighting is done here.<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>Anyway, my point is that even in Western Europe they are not consuming nearly the electricity we are in America.  But they pay for it in having FAR LESS COMFORT and CONVENIENCE.  I realized what makes our living standards in America higher is really that we are about the most COMFORTABLE and CONVENIENT country I know of (and I\\'ve been to more than most people).  It\\'s not just about the things we buy; it\\'s about the ENERGY we consume in lighting, central heating and air conditioning.<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>Anyone who wishes to reach me on this issue can email me at mlmimouna at gmail dot com.<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>\",\"commentTitle\":\"\",\"createDate\":\"1199281828\",\"updateDate\":\"1199282057\",\"approveDate\":\"1199282057\",\"userID\":49999773,\"userDisplayName\":\"Mary Duckworth (Demis) Mimouna\",\"userTitle\":null,\"userURL\":null,\"userLocation\":\"Marrakesh, Morocco\",\"editorsSelection\":0,\"recommendationCount\":20,\"replyCount\":0,\"assetID\":47193,\"assetURL\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/www.nytimes.com\\\\/2008\\\\/01\\\\/02\\\\/opinion\\\\/02diamond.html\",\"status\":\"approved\",\"commentType\":\"comment\",\"replies\":[]},{\"commentID\":20350,\"parentID\":null,\"statusID\":2,\"lft\":50,\"rgt\":51,\"commentSequence\":22,\"commentBody\":\"The problem I have with this piece is that he has joined Consumption to standard of living.

He is basically stating current consumption equilibria as fact.  For all I know he is right;  if not in degree than certainly in magnitude.<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>    The main beef I have with this piece is one I have with many experts, and supposed experts (Mr Diamond is the former genrally speaking), is making statements like the one below in the context of absolute fact:<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>    Since Sept. 11, 2001, it has become clear that the<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>    oceans that once protected the United States no<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>    longer do so.<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>I find these statements and others like them to be simply ludicrous.  I will put forth a very simple question to prove my point.  Would you the reader feel safer if a member of the Taliban in Islamabad could WALK in a few days to New York?  I think not.  Therefor our surounding oceans make us very safe to some threats.<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>      It is, nor has it ever been, a wall of invulnerability.  If we thought that wall existed on September 10th. it was only through our ignorance of the outside world and general complacency to its _possible_ threats.<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>     A reader would have to agree that your money is safer in a bank than under your matress.  However if the bank manager leaves the vault open for half the night you might feel better sleeping on your wealth.   The oceans are our vault.  So is our navy, our airforce, and our economy and technology.  But only to the degree that we pay attention!!<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>     It is Mr. Diamond\\'s statement like the one above and similar ones from our President that have ignored my above reasoning, maybe intentionally, and by doing so have done great harm to Amreica and our Freedoms.<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>     I am not afraid of our very real outside enemies like Al queda and the Taliban.  Because of our oceans.  Because we have the largest navy in the world.  Because they do not control an economy like ours or even one as big as a large US city.  Statements like Mr Diamond\\'s have simply put caused America to freak out.  To make our oceans protect us we just have to PAY ATTENTION and use our many, many advantages!  When we ignore or discount our absolute economic and military superiority or cultural force projection against our enemies we do silly things like needlessly invade other nations or take away Constitutionally given rights from our citizens.   \",\"commentTitle\":\"\",\"createDate\":\"1199281962\",\"updateDate\":\"1199282387\",\"approveDate\":\"1199282387\",\"userID\":31276463,\"userDisplayName\":\"AnalogKidd\",\"userTitle\":null,\"userURL\":null,\"userLocation\":\"Pittsburgh\",\"editorsSelection\":0,\"recommendationCount\":11,\"replyCount\":0,\"assetID\":47193,\"assetURL\":\"http:\\\\/\\\\/www.nytimes.com\\\\/2008\\\\/01\\\\/02\\\\/opinion\\\\/02diamond.html\",\"status\":\"approved\",\"commentType\":\"comment\",\"replies\":[]},{\"commentID\":20357,\"parentID\":null,\"statusID\":2,\"lft\":56,\"rgt\":57,\"commentSequence\":27,\"commentBody\":\"I find it curious that the article\\'s main points about consumption should attempt a link to terrorism, particularly the canard that Sept. 11 changed our ideas that oceans would protect us.

Not only do the figures not support this - as Professor Diamond makes clear with respect to Western Europe - but my own very unscientific and anecdotal experiences as a regular visitor to different parts of the US seem to contradict it.  The standard of living of the average professional Americans I meet often seems lower than my own.  This is particularly noticeable to me in terms of health care, education standards and costs, vacation time, public transport and the quality of food (this last varies hugely depending on where you are in the US, of course, but away from the coasts I\\'m often a bit shocked by the food).<br\\\\/><br\\\\/>I suspect that much of the popular opposition to different policies for the economics of the environment in the US still springs from this unquestioned insistence that Americans currently have the best living standards in the world.  Looking seriously at how other countries organize their societies and economies is therefore assumed to suggest a decrease in standards of living.  Whereas in fact, if most Americans knew just how well their counterparts in Western Europe are living, they might be much keener to examine different policies for their own society.  Given that Americans appear to travel much less than other first-world citizens, they are unlikely to discover this for themselves - which brings the focus back to the role of the media.  Just why do I read so regularly in the American press the blithe statement that US living-standards are the highest in the world?  American journalists owe their readers more than this, and should be vigorously challenging it when politicians make the same claim.

       "    u'commentBody': u' The Aliens and Predator fight again in this new sequel, which this time takes place in Colorado springs instead of Antarctica. The beginning of the story takes place in the Predator ship, and (of course you guessed it) an alien pops out of the (dead) Predator King\\'s stomach. The predators haven\\'t realized that their ship is infested with blood-sucking aliens. This causes the ship to crash land in Colorado springs, and their fight rages on again!<br/><br/> The cast includes Steven Pasquale (you might recognize him from \"Rescue Me\" the FX show and, \"Six Feet Under), who plays Dallas, a detective. And, John Ortiz (who you might remember from \"American Gangster\" and, \"Miami Vice\"), who plays the character of Morales.<br/><br/> The movie consist of very odd names but, the plot is great and so is the acting. This movie in the series was defiantly better in the first one, it has action and, there is more people and lines for them in this movie. People should defiantly go to see this movie, it was worth it!',\n",

A friend responded, \"you know, ten percent of that is just to keep us warm, since it\\'s so cold here.\"  My friend was simply recognizing intuitively something that should be obvious:  if Finland\\'s per capita GDP is ten percent bigger than Italy\\'s, then Finland is NOT richer.  That extra spending on heat doesn\\'t contribute to art, leisure, food, or any of the rest.

       "    u'commentBody': u'Jared,<br/><br/>I\\'ve been a great fan of yours for many years, and enjoyed this article as always.  However it is the first time I\\'ve ever found myself disagreeing with you about something.<br/><br/>I\\'m an American who moved to Morocco 16 years ago.  Living here for many years, and being acquainted with many Europeans, I can tell you that living standards in Western Europe do NOT meet typical American standards.  I also now understand why America is consuming so much more energy (which I learned as a child in school in the 1960\\'s but only now have come to truly understand).<br/><br/>Here is one example.  One night, while walking down the stairs in a friend\\'s apartment building where the elevator had been turned off (which happens all over here, because building owners are not required to pay the elevator maintainance fees to keep their elevators running, and they also do it to save electricity costs), the lights totally went out in the stairwell, six stories up.  Almost all lights in Morocco in buildings are on timers.  so you hit the button, and it stays on only for about 30 seconds before going off.  Only if you were a regular tenant or visitor in a given building would you know where to find these buttons in the dark.  When I later complained to my British friend about this, saying, \"If that ever happened in America, the building owner would be sued in two seconds,\" her reply was, \"Oh, don\\'t you have timers on lights in America?\"  I had an instant realization about how we leave lights on in parking garages 24 hours a day, and the same in office buildings and department stores, as well as indoor malls.  None of this lighting is done here.<br/><br/>Anyway, my point is that even in Western Europe they are not consuming nearly the electricity we are in America.  But they pay for it in having FAR LESS COMFORT and CONVENIENCE.  I realized what makes our living standards in America higher is really that we are about the most COMFORTABLE and CONVENIENT country I know of (and I\\'ve been to more than most people).  It\\'s not just about the things we buy; it\\'s about the ENERGY we consume in lighting, central heating and air conditioning.<br/><br/>Anyone who wishes to reach me on this issue can email me at mlmimouna at gmail dot com.<br/><br/>',\n",

       "    u'commentBody': u'Substances that salve and cure when used in moderation sometimes poison and kill when used excessively.  Does money have a similar property?<br/><br/>That political power corrupts is a matter of universal experience.  All forms of power, including the economic, religious, military varieties, appear to lead inexorably to corruption and dissipation as history has recorded.<br/><br/>Power also seeks more of it, just as the addict seeks more of the substance with each hit.  The super-rich  continue to seek and hoard wealth far beyond all rational need.  Some of them set out to look for political power which they see as nothing more than a conversion of one currency to another.  Some of us believe such transactions are unwholesome and even dangerous.  Our political institutions and, increasingly, our judicial leadership, too, do not appear to see much that is wrong with the emerging picture.<br/><br/>If the corrupting potential of economic power is allowed to fuse with that of political power the resulting system is bound to be immeasurably corrupt.  If Michael Bloomberg (or Mitt Romney) self-finances their way into the White House or if the shadowy millionaires who swiftboated Senator John Kerry right out of the water in 2004 are allowed to ratchet up their craft we might as well shed any pretense of a democratic way of life.',\n",

       "    u'commentBody': u\"    I have read Guns, Germs, and Steel, as well as many other books trying to explain the West's advantages throughout history.  I would say that William McNiel's are better.  So I think I can speak with some relevancing on Mr Diamond's work.  However, my main complaint is not with the major premise of the op-ed.  He is basically stating current consumption equilibria as fact.  For all I know he is right;  if not in degree than certainly in magnitude.<br/><br/>    The main beef I have with this piece is one I have with many experts, and supposed experts (Mr Diamond is the former genrally speaking), is making statements like the one below in the context of absolute fact:<br/><br/>    Since Sept. 11, 2001, it has become clear that the<br/><br/>    oceans that once protected the United States no<br/><br/>    longer do so.<br/><br/>I find these statements and others like them to be simply ludicrous.  I will put forth a very simple question to prove my point.  Would you the reader feel safer if a member of the Taliban in Islamabad could WALK in a few days to New York?  I think not.  Therefor our surounding oceans make us very safe to some threats.<br/><br/>      It is, nor has it ever been, a wall of invulnerability.  If we thought that wall existed on September 10th. it was only through our ignorance of the outside world and general complacency to its _possible_ threats.<br/><br/>     A reader would have to agree that your money is safer in a bank than under your matress.  However if the bank manager leaves the vault open for half the night you might feel better sleeping on your wealth.   The oceans are our vault.  So is our navy, our airforce, and our economy and technology.  But only to the degree that we pay attention!!<br/><br/>     It is Mr. Diamond's statement like the one above and similar ones from our President that have ignored my above reasoning, maybe intentionally, and by doing so have done great harm to Amreica and our Freedoms.<br/><br/>     I am not afraid of our very real outside enemies like Al queda and the Taliban.  Because of our oceans.  Because we have the largest navy in the world.  Because they do not control an economy like ours or even one as big as a large US city.  Statements like Mr Diamond's have simply put caused America to freak out.  To make our oceans protect us we just have to PAY ATTENTION and use our many, many advantages!  When we ignore or discount our absolute economic and military superiority or cultural force projection against our enemies we do silly things like needlessly invade other nations or take away Constitutionally given rights from our citizens.   \",\n",

And one reader\\'s comments on \"mimicing an abysmal failure\", If India\\'s education were such a hige failure, then why are the US Grad programs filled with Indians? Why are your top performers, including Citi\\'s CEO indian?<br/><br/>And to Indians who complained of rote learning, you are able to respond and think clearly and write on this forum due to your ability to \"Rote- Learn\"? I dont think so. While you grown up kids complain of having to deal with corporal punishment and rote learning, i do not see  you complaining about it when you had a 3.5+ GPA in your grad schools and are programming or doing Investment Banking jobs in America. All those who complained of that factor, why dont you try getting out of your Toyotas and suburban homes and going back to India to teach? Nope, the only thing that i gather you learnt at schoo lwas to complain and well you are doing a great job.<br/><br/>Education is something we learn,  so the entire point of a comparison is going to make some dumb American and some Dumb Indian fight against each other (Higlighted here by the Editor with a a positive bias, by omitting good comments). As for me, i learnt by heart as well, had to.. its a rat race out there, and if you are to survive, you have to evolve. And I am proud of my education. I am a better fit at the place i work in and did not study Modern English in the Dark Ages as a major to work in I-Banking. ',\n",

       "    u'commentBody': u'Anyone heard of the newest,trendiest spot in Sarasota?  Lakewood Ranch is an award winning community where living, working & playing is all in the same place.  I went with my family to check out LECOM for my daughter and was pleasantly surprised to stay at a fabulous Holiday Inn. This hotel was awarded the Quality Excellence and Torchbearer awards for the past 5 years and there is no question about service and product quality.  The best I have ever been to. If you want a great experience for dining, try their newly remolded Alamo Steakhouse Grill.  I will definately recommend to all my friends and collegues. ',\n",

       "    u'commentBody': u'It is ironic that the better standard of living the lower increase in population. The real problem is the developed nations have not been able to set the standard for a lower consumption; witch in the case of the US has little to do with standard of living. The country has an attitude of considering high consumption equal to good standard of living, thus encouraging the developing nations, with too high a population, to do the same. This trend will be the ultimate disaster. ',\n",

An editor should have caught that.  (2) He does not substantiate the his suggested relationship of economics and consumption rate to the violence of 9/11 and many other instances.  Absent something very explicit I\\'m more than skeptical.  Further there is little to nothing from the violence claimants to suggest that as a cause.<br/><br/>',\n",

       "    u'commentBody': u\"An insightful and informative article, and one which needs to be widely read, I think.<br/><br/>I'd like to echo the comment from Hungary (no.14) about the lack of awareness among many Americans of how their standard of living actually compares to other Western countries, including many which have significantly different political and economic policies, including those which affect the environment.<br/><br/>From my (outsiders') reading of US media, I'm frequently struck by the rarely-challenged received wisdom that the US enjoys the highest standard of living in the world.  Not only do the figures not support this - as Professor Diamond makes clear with respect to Western Europe - but my own very unscientific and anecdotal experiences as a regular visitor to different parts of the US seem to contradict it.  The standard of living of the average professional Americans I meet often seems lower than my own.  This is particularly noticeable to me in terms of health care, education standards and costs, vacation time, public transport and the quality of food (this last varies hugely depending on where you are in the US, of course, but away from the coasts I'm often a bit shocked by the food).<br/><br/>I suspect that much of the popular opposition to different policies for the economics of the environment in the US still springs from this unquestioned insistence that Americans currently have the best living standards in the world.  Looking seriously at how other countries organize their societies and economies is therefore assumed to suggest a decrease in standards of living.  Whereas in fact, if most Americans knew just how well their counterparts in Western Europe are living, they might be much keener to examine different policies for their own society.  Given that Americans appear to travel much less than other first-world citizens, they are unlikely to discover this for themselves - which brings the focus back to the role of the media.  Just why do I read so regularly in the American press the blithe statement that US living-standards are the highest in the world?  American journalists owe their readers more than this, and should be vigorously challenging it when politicians make the same claim.  Why don't they?\",\n",

       "    u'commentBody': u\"Again, like almost everyone addressing our most pressing problems, Diamond caves on one of the biggest root causes: the population issue.<br/><br/>Even if we reduce our consumption for our current world population, if growth in numbers continues we are only displacing the problem to the next generation. Sooner or later someone's going to have to have the guts to address the issue directly.<br/><br/>Control of family size changes very quickly when people have access to birth control and education. It may be easier to persuade people to have fewer children than to consume less. That trend is already established in many countries, and the change came quickly.<br/><br/>As a first step, the US could reinstitute its family planning support internationally and give up the fiction that abstinence-only education actually works. Catholics also need to do something about their church's continued stand against birth control, which looks more and more immoral for many reasons.<br/><br/>When will the day come when the Pope's stand against birth control is seen as morally suspect? Soon, I hope.\",\n",
